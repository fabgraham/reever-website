# Instagram Images Setup - Simple 3-Step Process

## Why Local Images?
Instagram blocks direct image loading from their servers due to API restrictions. The only reliable way to show Instagram images on your website is to download and host them locally. This is what most professional websites do.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download Your Instagram Images

1. Go to https://www.instagram.com/p/DQFUhsUDciC/
2. Right-click on the image → "Save Image As..."
3. Save it to `public/media/` folder as `instagram-1.jpg`

4. Go to https://www.instagram.com/p/DPwQyVTDGOf/
5. Right-click on the image → "Save Image As..."
6. Save it to `public/media/` folder as `instagram-2.jpg`

7. Go to https://www.instagram.com/p/DMc6NR9Nskw/
8. Right-click on the image → "Save Image As..."
9. Save it to `public/media/` folder as `instagram-3.jpg`

### Step 2: That's It!

The code is already set up. Once you save the images, refresh your browser and they'll appear.

### Step 3: Update Later (Optional)

To change which posts are shown:

1. Open `public/index.html`
2. Find the `instagramPosts` array (around line 1930)
3. Update the URLs and download new images

```javascript
const instagramPosts = [
  {
    url: 'https://www.instagram.com/p/YOUR_NEW_POST/',
    image: 'media/instagram-1.jpg',
    alt: 'Description of post'
  },
  // ... more posts
];
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ Images always load (no API failures)  
✅ Fast loading (served from your own server)  
✅ Clean look (no Instagram UI clutter)  
✅ Each image links to the actual Instagram post  
✅ Works on all browsers and devices  
✅ No authentication or API keys needed  

## Adding More Posts

Want to show 6 posts instead of 3? Just:
1. Download more images (instagram-4.jpg, instagram-5.jpg, etc.)
2. Add more entries to the `instagramPosts` array
3. The grid will automatically adjust!
